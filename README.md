# Reali Engineering Problem - task Drfat

Suggested solution draft (coding not complete) is intended for processing Big Files.
Idea is following:
1. CSV File downloaded from Web and saved on disk
2. Processing BIG file: splitting it to small files, and run thread to process each small file.  
	* Not waiting for split all, but working as following:
	* Read orig file, and write to new small file (where lines numvber is limited)  
		* If number of lines > MAX:
			* complete write to current file
			* Start processing current file (Thread)
				* check if line is matching. If Yes:
					* Convert csv line to GeoJson
					* Print GeoJson
			* Create new file and continue write to it
			.....

TODO:  
    - csvLineToJson(String line)  
	- printJSON(...)
